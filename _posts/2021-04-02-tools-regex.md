## Regular Expression

\b 单词边界, 单词就是\w组成的

### Flag
i: With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between A and a (see the example below).
g: With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it – only the first match is returned.
m: Multiline mode (covered in the chapter Multiline mode of anchors ^ $, flag "m").
s: Enables “dotall” mode, that allows a dot . to match newline character \n (covered in the chapter Character classes).
u: Enables full Unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate pairs. More about that in the chapter Unicode: flag "u" and class \p{...}.
y: “Sticky” mode: searching at the exact position in the text (covered in the chapter Sticky flag "y", searching at position)
