## Android Layout

* Android Linear Layout: LinearLayout is a ViewGroup subclass, used to provide child View elements one by one either in a particular direction either horizontally or vertically based on the orientation property.
* Android Relative Layout: RelativeLayout is a ViewGroup subclass, used to specify the position of child View elements relative to each other like (A to the right of B) or relative to the parent (fix to the top of the parent).
