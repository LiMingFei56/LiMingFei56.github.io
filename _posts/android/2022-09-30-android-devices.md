## android devices

### Emulator

If you need to refer to your host computer's localhost, such as when you want the emulator client to contact a server running on the host, use the alias 10.0.2.2 to refer to the host computer's loopback interface. From the emulator's perspective, localhost (127.0.0.1) refers to its own loopback interface.
