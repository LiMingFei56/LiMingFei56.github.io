## Concepts

### headless web

> Headless web is a term used to describe a web application or website that does
> not have a user interface (UI) in the traditional sense. Instead of rendering
> HTML pages on the server and sending them to the client's web browser to be
> displayed, a headless web application exposes its functionality through APIs
> (Application Programming Interfaces) that can be accessed over the internet.
> 
> This allows clients, such as web browsers, mobile apps, and other systems, to
> access and use the application's functionality without the need for a UI.
> Headless web applications are typically built using server-side languages like
> PHP, Ruby, or Python and are designed to be consumed by external clients using
> HTTP requests and responses.

### blockchain

> A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions
> on multiple computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively
> without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the
> network.
> 
> Each block in the chain contains a record of multiple transactions, and once
> data is recorded on a block, it cannot be altered. The decentralized nature of
> the blockchain makes it resistant to modification of data.
> 
> Blockchains are used for a variety of applications, such as tracking ownership
> or the provenance of documents, medical records, and other types of
> information. The most well-known use of blockchains is in the cryptocurrency
> bitcoin, but blockchains have many other potential applications that have not
> yet been fully realized.

### web 3.0

> Web 3.0 is a term used to describe the evolution of the World Wide Web, with a
> focus on semantic technologies and the integration of artificial intelligence.
> 
> Web 1.0, which was the first iteration of the World Wide Web, was a collection
> of static websites that provided information but did not allow for much
> interaction. Web 2.0, which is the current version of the web, is
> characterized by social media, user-generated content, and the ability for
> users to interact with each other and with websites in a more dynamic way.
> 
> Web 3.0 is thought to be the next evolution of the web, with a focus on using
> artificial intelligence and semantic technologies to create a more intuitive
> and intelligent web experience. It is expected to enable the web to understand
> and interpret users' needs and preferences, and to present them with relevant
> information in a more personalized and meaningful way. Some experts believe
> that Web 3.0 will also brikng about the widespread use of virtual and augmented
> reality on the web.

### metaverse

> The Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence
> of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space
> , including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.
> It is a shared space, created by human collaboration and imagination, which is
> enhanced by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or
> GPS data.
> 
> The term Metaverse is derived from the prefix "meta," meaning "beyond," and
> "universe," and was coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel
> "Snow Crash." In the novel, the Metaverse is a virtual reality space where
> users can interact with each other and with computer-generated objects and
> environments.
> 
> The concept of the Metaverse has gained popularity in recent years, with the
> proliferation of virtual reality technology and the increasing use of the
> internet and social media to connect people and create virtual communities.
> Some experts believe that the Metaverse will eventually become a fully
> immersive virtual world where people can interact with each other and with
> virtual objects and environments in a seamless and intuitive way.
